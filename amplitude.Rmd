## Burst amplitude

In order to show that it is burst amplitude (low in the case of Tamil) contributing to the misperception of /p/ as [h], the burst of pa_clean was amplified in Audacity by 12dB. The result was a Mid-diff of 32dB, consistent with the amplitude of English aspirated /p/ with a 200ms vowel (Narayan, 2022). The Mid-diff of the Tamil original was 42.3dB (higher the mid-diff the lower the amplitude).

This 32dB token was presented in an identification task. Hopefully it shows that listeners make less misclassification as [h].

pa    Mid-diff=42.3dB
pa_12   Mid-diff=32dB

pi    Mid-diff=32.1
pi_10   Mid-diff=26.6

pu    Mid0diff=52
pu_13 Mid-diff=37

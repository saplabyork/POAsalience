### Background
  
The current project is one of 2 or 3 studies I'm working on having to do with solving the problem of debuccalization in Old Kannada, where Old Tamil p&rarr;h. The oldest documented occurrance of this change is found in a 10th C. inscription from Srirangapatnam [910 AD: "...lōkakke hōhan" (for *pōpan*?)] (Narasimhia, 1941 p. 13; *Epigraphia Carnatica III, Seringapatam Taluq, 134*)


The question is *why* this happens. The typical path for this sort of debuccalization change is that p&rarr;f&rarr;h. The problem is that there is no evidence of an f stage in the change in Kannada. 

My theory is that there is internal phonetic/perceptual pressure affecting this change. Narayan (2022/3) shows that the burst characteristics of p in Tamil, which does not contrast voicing in word-initial position and has very short VOT, are low amplitude (relative to the amplitude of the vowel).

My hypothesis is that low amplitude bursts are potentially not heard and confusable with h. The thinking is that Old Kannada, which already had h (from Sanskrit borrowings), is confusable with low amplitude p bursts. 

The purpose of this study is to compare the discriminability of various place-of-articulation contrasts from Tamil: p, t̪ ,ʈ,k,and h. We are specifically targeting the discriminability of p vs. h against t̪ ,ʈ,k vs. h.

We will do an AX task for each pair of places of articulation in three SNR conditions. The prediction is the p-h will have a SDT d' score lower than t̪-h and ʈ-h and k-h.

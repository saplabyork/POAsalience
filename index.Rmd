# **The Burst Voice project**

[SAP Lab](https://saplabyork.github.io)

### Background

The current project is an **exploratory study** that follows from an earlier research project examining burst properties of oral voiceless consonants in prevocalic position (CV) as a function of speaking rate. In that project, I found that as people speak faster and faster, the bursts of their plosives decrease in amplitude. 

The reasoning is that as you speak faster there is less and less time for intraoral pressure to build up behind the constriction, so when the stop is released, the burst is more quiet than if there were more time (as in slower speech). I found this happening in both English (a language which contrasts voicing using short- and long-lag VOT) and Tamil (a language without phonological voicing in onset position and which only utilizes short lag VOT).

In the speaking rate research, the faster subjects spoke, the shorter their vowels in CVs. This was expected. So there is a correlation between pre-vocalic VOT and vowel duration. Take a look at this picture.

So, pre-vocalic VOT is positively correlated with the duration of the following vowel. The question I am asking in the current research is tangentially related to the vowel duration effect on the burst and VOT. It is well known that vowel duration varies with the voicing of the post-vocalic consonant in most (if not all) languages that contrast voice in coda position. So in English, the "a" in "pad" is longer than the "a" in "pat". 

## How/why does the vowel duration effect happen?

There are a number of theories as to why this happens (see [this](papers/chen1970.pdf) if you're interested), but the most promising is that the "b" articulation is *slower* than the "p" articulation and the force of the voiceless articulation is greater than with the voiced (remember $F=ma$?). Anyway, the slower acceleration of the articulation in voiced results in a longer preceding vowel. 

## Another effect of coda voicing

Voicing is generally accompanied by larynx lowering. Recall the "pitch pertubation" effect, where the F0 of the vowel after a voiced consonant is lower than after a voiceless consonant. There is some research suggesting that larynx lowering occurs before voiced *coda* consonants as well. Please have a look at this [paper](papers/bauer2011.pdf) by Bauer. He shows, using a method he developed with a portable ultrasound machine, that the hyoid bone (which is coupled with the rest of the larynx) is lower before voiced consonants than before voiceless consonants, and that the lowering occurs very early in the vowel (within the first 20% of the vowel). There seems to be some speaker variation here but let's assume that indeed the larynx is lower before voiced stops and that this lowering occurs *before* the stop closure.

1. If the larynx is lower before voiced stops that would mean that the volume of the oral cavity is larger before voiced stops. I am hypothesizing that as a result of the larger volume of pressurized air behind the closure there will be *concomitant effects* on the aerodynamic characteristics of the burst, namely **longer** aspiration before voiced stops. I predict that if we do find such an effect there will be lots of between speaker variation and the *size* of the effect will be small (as larynx lowering) increases the the volume by 2ml (by some estimates, see Rothenberg, 1968).

In this exercise we will be measuring VOT in words like "pat", "pad", "pot", "pod", "tat", "tad", etc. It is imperative that these measurements are made precisely as I'm expecting the effect to be small (if it's there at all!).
  
2. If we do find an effect, that is, speakers have longer VOT for "p" in "pad" than they do for the "p" in "pat", do listeners know/use this knowledge to inform their perception of the coda C voicing? This will be a perception test where listeners hear just the burst and first few cycles of the vowel of a CVC and guess what the final C is. For example, they will hear "pa-" and have to guess whether they heard "pat" or "pad". This will be the second experiment in the project.

### Gameplan

Part 1 of the project is acoustics. We will record 20 speakers of Canadian English (10 female, 10 male) in the Phonetics Studio (Ross S114). They will read this [word ldocs/Burst_voice_wordlist_new.docx) twice. The list represent real word pairs like "pat"/"pad" for three voiceless onset places of articulation (p,t,k) and five lax vowels (I, E, uh, c, ae), and three voiced/voiceless places of articulation in coda position (p,t,k). Not all combinations are represented, only real words.

Student members of the SAP Lab will assist in measuring:

1. **VOT**--Go through recording files, locate target words (correlate with the word list), identify and precisely locate onset VOTs on a text grid in Praat
2. **Vowel duration**--On another tier of the text grid, identify the onset and offset of the vowel in the target word
3. Run a Praat script (twice) on every recording file which will extract the durations of VOT and the Vowel.
4. Organize the output from the script into an Excel spreadsheet

Lab volunteers should go to the Acoustics methods tab to learn how to measure VOT, run the praat script, and create a spreadsheet with your values.

Part 2 of the project is perception, and really depends on the results of Part 1. If part 1 pans out, and speakers actually have longer VOTs when coda C is voiced, then we can test whether listeners *use* this knowledge.
